    position: 'Senior Frontend Developer',
    jobDescription:  '<h4><a href="http://win2day.at" target="_blank">Win2Day</a> platform frontend development.</h4>\
    <ul>\
    <li>The decision of the frontend architecture was already made when I was joined to the company. My task was to continue and finish it.</li>\
    <li>The professional design was also created by the agency, but as Developer I was having some freedom to design, how the page should behave in different screen resolutions, how it should reat on the user actions, how elements shoud be animated. Because of the high amount of users many device was supported, and the developers should take care, that the page design fits to all of them in any conditions, like e.g.: the dropdown menü shold also work within an overlay on a small mobile screen even if there is no space left, or the items can not be scrolled.</li>\
    <li>Becasue of my experience in the gaming industrie I was having the task to implement the games into the frontend. On the beginning it was look like an impossible task, because\
      <ol>\
        <li>high amount of games was made with different technologies like flash or html5,</li>\
        <li>they was having very various sizes and aspect ratios,</li>\
        <li>some of them was having a maximal display size,</li>\
        <li>some of them was responsible on it&apos;s own, managed by self contained scripts</li>\
        <li>some of them could be resized,</li>\
        <li>and some I was unable to scale at all. (only css transform was possible)</li>\
        <li>On "desktop" devices the games shold be able to play in fullscreen, but with the conditions written abowe,</li>\
        <li>and because it was not a build in function for all of the games, it shoud be implemented also by us.</li>\
        <li>Some games was designed only for desktop usage,</li>\
        <li>some only for mobile,</li>\
        <li>and some for both.</li>\
        <li>Furthermore, - as usual - the agency worked separatly from the customer company, so we only received some example games, not all of them, for each and every possible cases.</li>\
      </ol>This was definitely the biggest challange in the frontend, because the games was the core concept of the platform.</li>\
    <li>During the daily work while I was implementing pages and features I was continously experimenting and thinking, and with the help of my colleges and the backend developers of the client, after some good ideas, we was successfully fulfilled the task, and all of the planned games was implemented.</li>\
    <li>Also several interesting solutions was also created, like the CSS only Lotto Balls, the flexbox "grid like" responsive accordion, or the "real-time" Tournaments items.</li>\
