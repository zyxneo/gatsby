Than displayed statistic and so on. So I was not learning anymore, but started to program. I liked it so much, that I published it on the net, so anyone could using it. It had a toplist too. Later it turned out, that the way it works is "not optimal" for the server. So I wrote a new version of it. And a new again, I think the fourth one was the one online the longest time. Based on the feedbacks people loved it, so it is still online, even if flash is death sine that. It has so many hidden features, that sometime it can suprise me too.',

    description: 'This time I wanted to create something cute and funny. The scene is random, beside the castle sometime appears fruit trees, sometimes pine trees, or other objects. A random color hedgehog or snail may cross over, or a rainbow appear in front of random clouds. The design is based on child graphics, the content is lean, but there always happen something. You can even trune the fruits. The kindergarten was liked it, they still keep it.',
